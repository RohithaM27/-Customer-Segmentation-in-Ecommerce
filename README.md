# 🛒 Customer Segmentation in E-commerce using KNN and RFM

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on optimizing marketing strategies in the e-commerce space through data-driven customer segmentation. By analyzing customer purchasing behavior, engagement patterns, and spending habits, the project builds actionable customer segments that support retention, re-engagement, and targeted marketing decisions.

Using RFM analysis and KNN clustering, the model classifies customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, translating insights into clear business strategies for growth.
